# Documentation Diagrams

## Overview

This directory contains architectural and design diagrams for the Family Service, created using PlantUML and exported as SVG files.

## Features

- **Architecture Diagrams**: High-level architecture and deployment diagrams
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Flow of operations for key processes
- **Class Diagrams**: Structure of key components and their relationships
- **Data Model Diagrams**: Entity relationships and data structures
- **Use Case Diagrams**: User interactions with the system
- **Test Diagrams**: Test coverage and processes

## Installation

These diagrams are part of the documentation and do not require installation. To edit the diagrams, you'll need PlantUML.

```bash
# Install PlantUML (example for Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install plantuml

# For macOS
brew install plantuml
```

## Quick Start

To view these diagrams, open the SVG files in any web browser or image viewer. To edit the diagrams, modify the PUML files and regenerate the SVG files.

```bash
# Generate SVG from PUML
plantuml -tsvg filename.puml
```

## API Documentation

### Core Types

This directory does not contain code, only documentation diagrams.

## Examples

There may be additional examples in the /EXAMPLES directory.

### Diagram Types

#### Architecture Diagrams

The architecture diagrams show the high-level structure of the Family Service, including:
- Hexagonal architecture
- Domain-Driven Design concepts
- Deployment containers

#### Sequence Diagrams

The sequence diagrams show the flow of operations for key processes, such as:
- Creating a family
- Software design document sequences

## Best Practices

1. **Diagram Naming**: Use descriptive names for diagram files
2. **File Organization**: Keep related diagrams together
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent styling across diagrams
4. **Documentation Links**: Reference these diagrams in relevant documentation
5. **Version Control**: Update diagrams when architecture changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### SVG Not Updating

If SVG files are not updating after modifying PUML files, ensure you're regenerating the SVG files correctly.
