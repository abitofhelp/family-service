# Security Adapter

## Overview

The Security Adapter package provides functionality for securing the application. It includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security-related features to protect the application and its data.

## Architecture

This package is part of the infrastructure layer in the Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture patterns. It provides adapters for security that can be used by the application.

## Implementation Details

The Security Adapter implements the following design patterns:
- Strategy Pattern: Allows different security strategies to be used
- Decorator Pattern: Wraps existing functionality with security capabilities
- Factory Pattern: Creates instances of security components
- Chain of Responsibility: Processes security checks in sequence

## Examples

For complete, runnable examples, see the following directories in the EXAMPLES directory:
- [Authentication Example](../../../examples/auth_directive/README.md) - Shows how to use the authentication features
- [Authorization Example](../../../examples/authorization/README.md) - Shows how to use the authorization features

## Configuration

The Security Adapter can be configured with the following options:
- Authentication Providers: Configure which authentication providers to use
- Authorization Rules: Configure which authorization rules to apply
- Encryption Settings: Configure encryption algorithms and keys
- Token Settings: Configure token generation and validation

## Testing

The Security Adapter is tested through:
1. Unit Tests: Each security method has comprehensive unit tests
2. Integration Tests: Tests that verify the security adapter works correctly with the application
3. Security Tests: Tests that verify the security adapter protects against common vulnerabilities

## Design Notes

1. The Security Adapter supports multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
2. Authorization is role-based and can be configured at different levels
3. Encryption uses industry-standard algorithms and best practices
4. Security features are designed to be unobtrusive but comprehensive
