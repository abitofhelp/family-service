# Profiling Adapter

## Overview

The Profiling Adapter package provides functionality for profiling the application's performance. It includes tools for CPU profiling, memory profiling, and tracing, allowing developers to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the application.

## Architecture

This package is part of the infrastructure layer in the Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture patterns. It provides adapters for profiling that can be used by the application.

## Implementation Details

The Profiling Adapter implements the following design patterns:
- Decorator Pattern: Wraps existing functionality with profiling capabilities
- Strategy Pattern: Allows different profiling strategies to be used
- Factory Pattern: Creates instances of profilers

## Examples

For complete, runnable examples, see the following directories in the EXAMPLES directory:
- [Profiling Example](../../../examples/profiling/README.md) - Shows how to use the profiling adapter

## Configuration

The Profiling Adapter can be configured with the following options:
- Profiling Type: Configure which type of profiling to use (CPU, memory, trace)
- Profiling Duration: Configure how long profiling should run
- Profiling Output: Configure where profiling data should be saved
- Sampling Rate: Configure the sampling rate for profiling

## Testing

The Profiling Adapter is tested through:
1. Unit Tests: Each profiling method has comprehensive unit tests
2. Integration Tests: Tests that verify the profiling adapter works correctly with the application

## Design Notes

1. The Profiling Adapter uses the standard Go profiling tools (pprof)
2. Profiling can be enabled/disabled at runtime
3. Profiling data can be saved to files or exposed via HTTP
4. The adapter minimizes performance impact when not actively profiling
