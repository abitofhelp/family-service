# Errors Adapter

## Overview

The Errors Adapter package provides a comprehensive set of error types and utilities for error handling in the application. It defines domain-specific error types and provides functions for creating and handling errors.

## Architecture

This package is part of the infrastructure layer in the Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture patterns. It provides adapters for error handling that can be used by the application.

## Implementation Details

The Errors Adapter implements the following design patterns:
- Factory Pattern: Creates instances of error types
- Decorator Pattern: Adds context and metadata to errors
- Chain of Responsibility: Propagates errors through the application

## Examples

For complete, runnable examples, see the following directories in the EXAMPLES directory:
- [Errors Example](../../../examples/errors/README.md) - Shows how to use the error types
- [Family Errors Example](../../../examples/family_errors/README.md) - Shows how to use domain-specific error types

## Configuration

The Errors Adapter can be configured with the following options:
- Error Codes: Configure which error codes are used for different error types
- Error Messages: Configure the format of error messages
- Error Logging: Configure how errors are logged

## Testing

The Errors Adapter is tested through:
1. Unit Tests: Each error type has comprehensive unit tests
2. Integration Tests: Tests that verify the error handling works correctly with the application

## Design Notes

1. The Errors Adapter uses a hierarchical approach to error types
2. Errors include context information to aid in debugging
3. Error types are designed to be serializable for API responses
