# Repository Adapter

## Overview

The Repository Adapter package provides base implementations and utilities for repository adapters. It implements common functionality that can be reused by specific repository implementations like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite adapters.

## Architecture

This package is part of the infrastructure layer in the Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture patterns. It provides base adapters for repositories that can be extended by specific database adapters.

## Implementation Details

The Repository Adapter implements the following design patterns:
- Repository Pattern: Provides a clean interface for data access
- Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of repository operations
- Strategy Pattern: Allows different database strategies to be used
- Factory Pattern: Creates instances of repositories

## Examples

For complete, runnable examples, see the following directories in the EXAMPLES directory:
- [Repository Example](../../../examples/repository/README.md) - Shows how to use the repository adapters

## Configuration

The Repository Adapter can be configured with the following options:
- Repository Options: Configure common repository options
- Caching Strategy: Configure how repositories cache data
- Retry Strategy: Configure how repositories retry operations
- Timeout Strategy: Configure how repositories handle timeouts

## Testing

The Repository Adapter is tested through:
1. Unit Tests: Each repository method has comprehensive unit tests
2. Integration Tests: Tests that verify the repository adapters work correctly with different databases

## Design Notes

1. The Repository Adapter provides base implementations that can be extended by specific database adapters
2. Common functionality like caching, retries, and timeouts are implemented at this level
3. The adapter follows the domain repository interfaces defined in the domain layer
4. Error handling is consistent with the application's error handling strategy
