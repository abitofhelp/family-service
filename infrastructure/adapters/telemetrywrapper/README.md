# Telemetry Wrapper

## Overview

The Telemetry Wrapper package provides functionality for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data from the application. It includes metrics, traces, and logs, allowing developers to monitor the application's performance and behavior.

## Architecture

This package is part of the infrastructure layer in the Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture patterns. It provides adapters for telemetry that can be used by the application.

## Implementation Details

The Telemetry Wrapper implements the following design patterns:
- Decorator Pattern: Wraps existing functionality with telemetry capabilities
- Strategy Pattern: Allows different telemetry strategies to be used
- Factory Pattern: Creates instances of telemetry components
- Observer Pattern: Notifies observers of telemetry events

## Examples

For complete, runnable examples, see the following directories in the EXAMPLES directory:
- [Telemetry Example](../../../examples/telemetry/README.md) - Shows how to use the telemetry wrapper

## Configuration

The Telemetry Wrapper can be configured with the following options:
- Metrics Configuration: Configure which metrics to collect and how to export them
- Tracing Configuration: Configure which traces to collect and how to export them
- Logging Configuration: Configure which logs to collect and how to export them
- Sampling Rate: Configure the sampling rate for telemetry data

## Testing

The Telemetry Wrapper is tested through:
1. Unit Tests: Each telemetry method has comprehensive unit tests
2. Integration Tests: Tests that verify the telemetry wrapper works correctly with the application
3. Performance Tests: Tests that verify the telemetry wrapper has minimal performance impact

## Design Notes

1. The Telemetry Wrapper supports multiple telemetry backends (Prometheus, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
2. Telemetry data is collected with minimal performance impact
3. The wrapper provides a consistent interface for all telemetry types
4. Telemetry can be enabled/disabled at runtime
