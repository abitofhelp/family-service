# Tests

## Overview

This directory contains tests for the Family Service that span multiple packages or require special setup. It is organized by test type, with subdirectories for integration tests and potentially other test categories.

## Features

- **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify the interaction between multiple components
- **Test Organization**: Structured organization of tests by type
- **Test Utilities**: Shared utilities and helpers for tests
- **Test Configuration**: Configuration files specific to testing
- **Test Data**: Test data and fixtures

## Installation

These tests are part of the project and do not require separate installation.

## Quick Start

To run all tests, including unit tests and integration tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run integration tests only
make integration-test
```

## API Documentation

### Core Types

This directory primarily contains test files rather than API types.

## Examples

There may be additional examples in the /EXAMPLES directory.

### Test Types

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components of the system. They are located in the `integration` subdirectory.

```bash
# Run integration tests
cd tests/integration
go test ./...
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
2. **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage
3. **Test Organization**: Organize tests by type and functionality
4. **Test Documentation**: Document the purpose and setup of each test
5. **Test Performance**: Keep tests fast to encourage frequent testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Flaky Tests

If tests are inconsistent (sometimes passing, sometimes failing), they may be affected by external state or timing issues.

#### Slow Tests

If tests are running slowly, consider using test parallelization or mocking external dependencies.
