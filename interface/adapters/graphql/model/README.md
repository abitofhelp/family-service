# GraphQL Models

## Overview

This directory contains GraphQL model definitions for the Family Service, including both manually created models and those generated by gqlgen.

## Features

- **Custom Models**: Manually defined GraphQL models
- **Generated Models**: Models automatically generated from the GraphQL schema
- **Type Definitions**: Go type definitions that match GraphQL types
- **Model Customization**: Extensions and customizations of generated models
- **GraphQL Type Mapping**: Mapping between GraphQL and Go types

## Installation

These models are part of the GraphQL interface and do not require separate installation.

## Quick Start

The models in this directory are used by the GraphQL resolvers to implement the GraphQL API. To use these models in your resolver implementations:

```
// Example usage in a resolver
import (
    "github.com/abitofhelp/family-service/interface/adapters/graphql/model"
)

func (r *queryResolver) GetFamily(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.Family, error) {
    // Implementation
}
```

## API Documentation

### Core Types

#### Models

The models in this directory define the structure of GraphQL types.

```
// Example model definition
type Family struct {
    ID     string    `json:"id"`
    Name   string    `json:"name"`
    Status string    `json:"status"`
    // Other fields
}
```

#### Generated Models

Some models are generated automatically by gqlgen based on the GraphQL schema.

## Examples

There may be additional examples in the /EXAMPLES directory.

## Best Practices

1. **Separate Concerns**: Keep GraphQL models separate from domain entities
2. **Use DTOs**: Use Data Transfer Objects to convert between domain entities and GraphQL models
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for model fields
4. **Field Documentation**: Document model fields with comments
5. **Validation**: Implement validation for model fields where appropriate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Type Mismatches

If you encounter type mismatches between GraphQL and Go, ensure your model definitions match the GraphQL schema.

#### Missing Fields

If fields are missing in the GraphQL response, check that all required fields are defined in the model.
